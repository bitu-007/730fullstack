Ecmascript: ecmascript maintains the version for scripting languages
ES13 is the latest version and important version is ES6
ES6 released in 2015, also known as ES2015 released so many features for JS. some of them are
i. arrow functions
ii. let and const
iii. template literals
iv. OOPS(objects,classes)
v. rest and spread
vi. destructuring
vii. modules etc..,

i. arrow functions:
function display (a)
{
    console.log("hello world"+a)
}
const display2 = (a) =>
{
    console.log("hello world"+a)
}

ii. template literals:
this is a way to combine data with strings without breaking the strings

let a = 50, b = 55;
console.log("the sum of " + a + " and " + b + "  is " + (a + b))
console.log(`the sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`)

iii. let and const:
console.log(k) // undefined
var k = 25;
let c = 44;
c = 45; // let cannot redeclare but can reassign
const d = 85 // const cannot reassign
// let and const can't be used before initialization

let and const are block scoped variables and var is a function scoped variables

iv. OOP(object oriented programming):
Every physical entity with certain properties is object and the collection of object is class

let emp1 = {
    name:"raj",
    age:55,
    salary:20000
}
